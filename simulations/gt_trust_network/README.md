# Game Theory Trust Network

We're modeling networks of prisoner's dilema players.


### Async vs sync

Synchronous version works much like a cellular automata: using data from the current time frame we compute the future time frame.

The async version takes a random node at a time and has it play with all its neighbors.

The multithread version implements random walkers that go from edge to edge and have the nodes at each side play. Walker moves through connected edges. It starts from another random edge if it reaches a dead end. Multithread version uses Elixir but we might look into SQL-Alchemy's  [Declarative](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/extensions/declarative.html).




### Optimise trust or fitness

Nodes in the network are prisoner's dilema players, so they have a state that defines their current strategy: they can either be True or False. They also have fitness which is affected by the outcome of a "throw" in the game.

We wrote two algorithms for setting a node's state: one optimises node fitness, the other optimises node trustability. Nodes change their strategy in response to their own fitness and the weight of the trust relationships to their neighbors.

Edges create relationships of two players and store the amount of trust among them, as their weight.




### Rewiring

On rewiring models edges that have trust levels =< 0 are removed and new edges are created in their stead.
