\section{Biomedical research: CONACyT and FOSISS}
\label{sec:1}
CONACyT (Council of Science and Technology) is the Mexican government entity in charge of promoting the development of science and
technology. It is also in charge of creating the country's scientific policies. CONACyT is equivalent to the National Science Foundation of the United States.\\

Among CONACyT's functions it is to develop science and technology
policies according to national needs and demands, to offer
assessorship to the different instances of the government on
scientific and technological topics, to promote the creation of
research networks among the scientific community, grant scholarships
for masters and doctoral studies, and it also manages different trusts intended to fund individuals
and groups for scientific and technological research. \\

In the year 2002 CONACyT, along with other government agencies and entities have created sectorial funds or \emph{Fondos Sectoriales}. Sectorial funds are trusts for scientific and technological research. The objective of such funds is to cover and equally promote the research capacities of different areas such as energy, agriculture, or technological innovation by means of the generation of human resources and helping research groups to consolidate. It is expected that the knowledge generated under the sponsorship of \emph{Fondos Sectoriales} to be the product of applied research that attends national public needs, and promotes economic growth.\\

\emph{FOSISS} or Sectorial Fund for Health and Social Security Research (\emph{Fondo Sectorial en Investigaci\'on en Salud y Seguridad Social}) is among such funds. FOSISS is constituted by CONACyT, SSA, IMSS and ISSSTE \footnote{SSA is the acronym for Secretariat of Health \emph{Secretar\'ia de Salud}; IMSS is the acronym for Social Security Mexican Institute (\emph{Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social}); ISSSTE stands for Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (\emph{Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado})}, being all of them the major public health providers and research institutions in the country. Every year CONACyT opens a call for funds constrained to a set the health areas previously defined by a group of experts. Elegibility is open to the public and private health research sectors, nevertheless, most applicants are public universities and research institutions.
