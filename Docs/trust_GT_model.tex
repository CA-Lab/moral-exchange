\section{Model Description}

The purpose of this model is to study the evolution of the topology of
networks in the context of evolutionary game theory.
Great amounts of work can be found in bringing together these areas of
research. Mmost of it has been focused in understading how under different
topological circumstances and strategies either cooperators or
defectors populate the network. Our objective is different. We are
interested in understanding how different strategies adopted by
players shape the topology of networks. In our proposal,  nodes are
connected by weigthed links. The weight of the link represents a
degree of trust among players. Players may choose to cooperate or
defect and that individual decision may bring them a benefit and/or
cost and, at the same time will have an impact on the degree of trust
among players. When trust degree trasspasses below certain threshold
the link between players will be broken and they will reconnect to
another node with the initial value of trustness. In such a way, an
initially Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi or regular lattice, will evolve to different topologies.



\subsection{Step one: Setting up the model}

We start from two possible scenarios, a regular lattice in which all nodes have the
same number of links and neighbors, and a second one in which the
starting point is an Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi networks where all nodes have the
same $\emph{p}$ of connecting with other nodes in the network. $\varphi$
